# `isle`: Introduction to Statistical Learning in Economics

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

`isle` is an open-source educational resource designed to guide you through the fascinating world of **statistical learning**, with a focus on its applications in **economics**. This repository provides a comprehensive set of interactive **Jupyter** notebooks that implement the concepts and methods presented in the renowned book:

-   [**An Introduction to Statistical Learning**](https://www.statlearning.com) (ISL) by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Rob Tibshirani, and Jonathan Taylor.

Specifically, `isle` leverages the **Python edition** of ISL (ISLP) and its associated labs, adapting them for an economics-focused audience. You'll discover how to apply powerful statistical learning techniques to analyze economic data, build predictive models, and gain valuable insights into economic phenomena.

## Why `isle`?

-   **Economics Focus:** While based on ISLP, `isle` provides additional context, examples, and exercises tailored to the field of economics.
-   **Interactive Learning:** The Jupyter notebooks allow you to experiment with code, modify parameters, and visualize results directly in your browser, making the learning process engaging and intuitive.
-   **Based on a Classic:** `isle` builds upon the solid foundation of "An Introduction to Statistical Learning," a widely acclaimed textbook known for its clear explanations and practical approach.
-   **Python Implementation:** Leverage the power and versatility of Python for statistical learning, using libraries like `statsmodels`, `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, and `numpy`.
-   **In-Browser Execution:** Run the notebooks directly in your browser - no complex setup required!
-   **Open Source & Community-Driven:** `isle` is open-source, welcoming contributions and collaborations from the economics and data science communities.

## What You'll Learn

`isle` covers a wide range of statistical learning topics, including:

-   **Introduction to Statistical Learning:**  What is statistical learning and how is it applied in economics?
-   **Linear Regression:**  Estimate relationships between economic variables and make predictions.
-   **Classification:** Build models to classify economic outcomes (e.g., recession/expansion, credit default/no default).
-   **Resampling Methods:**  Assess the accuracy and variability of your models using techniques like cross-validation and bootstrapping.
-   **Linear Model Selection and Regularization:** Improve model performance and interpretability using techniques like Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net.
-   **Moving Beyond Linearity:**  Explore non-linear relationships using polynomial regression, splines, and generalized additive models.
-   **Tree-Based Methods:**  Understand and apply decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting for economic modeling.
-   **Support Vector Machines:**  Learn how to use SVMs for classification and regression tasks.
-   **Deep Learning:** Get an introduction to neural networks and their potential applications in economics.
-   **Survival Analysis:** Analyze time-to-event data, such as the duration of unemployment spells.
-   **Unsupervised Learning:** Discover patterns and structure in economic data using techniques like principal component analysis and clustering.
-   **Multiple Testing:** Address the challenges of multiple hypothesis testing in economic research.

## Based on the Book

`isle` is directly inspired by and closely follows:

-   [**An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python**](https://www.statlearning.com) (ISLP) by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Rob Tibshirani, and Jonathan Taylor.

**It is highly recommended to use `isle` in conjunction with the ISLP textbook for a comprehensive understanding of the theoretical concepts and their practical implementation.**

The notebooks in `isle` adapt and extend the Python labs from ISLP, providing an economics-specific perspective.

## Notebooks

The repository is organized into chapters, mirroring the structure of the ISLP book. Each chapter contains:

-   **Jupyter Notebooks:** Interactive notebooks with code, explanations, and exercises.
-   **Economic Examples:** Data sets and examples relevant to economic analysis.

You can navigate the notebooks using the three-stripe menu button in the upper-left corner on mobile devices or the table of contents panel on the left side of the browser window.

## Getting Started

1.  **Run in your browser:** The notebooks are designed for in-browser execution using platforms like Binder or JupyterLite. Click on the links to launch the interactive environment.
2.  **Run & Experiment:** Execute the code cells, modify parameters, and observe how the results change.
